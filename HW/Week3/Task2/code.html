    <h1>Jenkins on Ice</h1>
    <p>Retired NBA star Dennis Jenkins announced today that he has signed 
        a contract with Long Sleep to have his body frozen before death, to 
        be revived only when medical science has discovered a cure to the 
        aging process.</p>
    <p>&#39;Lots of guys get frozen for cancer and stuff, &#39; explains the 
        always-entertaining Jenkins, &#39;I just want to return once they can give
        me back my eternal youth.&#39; [sic] Perhaps Jenkins is also hoping medical 
        science can cure his free-throw shooting - 47% and falling during his 
        last year in the league.</p>
    <p>A reader tells us that Jenkins may not be aware that part of the Long 
        Sleep process is to remove the head, keeping only the brain to be revived. 
        This would be a problem for Jenkins since he would be left with his 
        least-valuable asset.</p>
